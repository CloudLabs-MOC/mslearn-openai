### Explanation of Components

- **Azure OpenAI**: Integrates your data with massive language models, allowing for personalized and secure interactions.Allows for fine-tuning of AI models with your own datasets, resulting in specialized and relevant outputs for your business needs.
- **Azure OpenAI Models**: Provides pre-trained and customisable big language models for a variety of AI applications, including text generation, sentiment analysis, and language translation, with the option to tailor models to specific use cases.
- **Azure CloudShell**: Offers an online, browser-based shell for managing Azure resources and running scripts.Allows you to deploy, manage, and automate Azure services directly from your web browser, eliminating the need for local installations.
- **DALL-E**: DALL-E uses artificial intelligence technology to generate visuals from written descriptions.Enhances creativity by translating word inputs into distinct and coherent pictures.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Prompt engineering fine-tunes input prompts to improve AI model replies, ensuring accurate and relevant outputs by optimizing how prompts are produced and delivered to AI models.
- **AI chat**: AI chat also known as an AI chatbot or conversational AI, is a technology that uses artificial intelligence to facilitate automated, human-like conversations between machines and users. These systems are designed to understand and interpret natural language inputs, enabling them to respond in a way that simulates a real conversation.

## Getting Started with Lab

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) and lab guide will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab. You can see the number on the lab guide bottom area to switch to different exercises of the lab guide.
