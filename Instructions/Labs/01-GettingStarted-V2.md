# Develop Generative with Azure OpenAI - Use Azure OpenAI SDKs in your app - 02
### Overall Estimated Duration: 60 minutes
## Overview

In this lab, you will explore the integration of Azure OpenAI Service with an application by provisioning an OpenAI resource and deploying the GPT-35-Turbo model. You will begin by creating an Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal and deploying the model to enable advanced language capabilities. Following that, you will set up an application in Cloud Shell and configure it to interact with the deployed model. You will then test the application by sending prompts and reviewing responses to verify functionality. Lastly, you will implement conversation history tracking, allowing the application to maintain context across interactions. This hands-on experience will provide practical skills in deploying and integrating AI models into applications, leveraging the security and scalability of Azure.

## Objective

Understand how to provision, deploy, and integrate Azure OpenAI models into an application, while maintaining conversation history. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

**Provision an Azure OpenAI Resource**: Set up an Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal to enable AI functionalities.

**Deploy a Model**: Deploy a GPT-35-Turbo model within Azure OpenAI Studio, preparing it for interaction with your application.

**Set Up an Application in Cloud Shell**: Use Cloud Shell to create and configure an application that integrates with the Azure OpenAI model.

**Configure Your Application**: Update your application with the necessary configurations to enable communication with the deployed OpenAI model.

**Test Your Application**: Test your application's functionality by sending requests and reviewing responses from the OpenAI model.

**Maintain Conversation History**: Implement functionality to retain conversation history, ensuring your application can handle context-aware interactions.

## Prerequisites
Participants should have:

**Familiarity with Azure OpenAI Service**: Understanding of the capabilities and applications of Azure OpenAI, including its role in natural language processing and AI model deployment.

**Experience with Azure Portal**: Proficiency in navigating the Azure Portal, including creating and managing resources, as well as configuring settings for various Azure services.

**Basic Understanding of AI Concepts**: Familiarity with generative AI concepts, including prompts, parameters, and model responses, to effectively interact with and utilize the AI models.

**Programming Knowledge**: Basic knowledge of programming concepts, particularly in Python, to understand and evaluate code snippets generated by the AI model.

## Architecture

In this lab, the architecture centers around the Azure OpenAI Service, where you will provision an OpenAI resource and deploy the GPT-35-Turbo model. The architecture includes the Azure OpenAI Studio, which serves as the primary interface for interacting with the model, enabling users to utilize the Completions and Chat playgrounds for experimentation with prompts and response refinement. Additionally, a Cloud Shell application is integrated into the architecture, allowing for configuration and testing of the application while maintaining conversation history. This architecture enhances application functionality by leveraging advanced language processing and code generation capabilities, while also facilitating effective monitoring and management of model performance within the Azure environment.
