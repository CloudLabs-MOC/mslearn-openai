### Task 3: Explore a model in the Completions playground

In this task ,You'll Explore a model in the Completions playground involves interacting with the AI model to test and refine its responses using real-time input and output examples.

1. In Azure OpenAI Studio, in the left pane under **Playground**, select **Completions**.

1. In the **Completions (1)** page, ensure your **my-gpt-model (2)** deployment is selected , Type **Generate a quiz (3)** in the prompt and then click on **Generate (4)**

      ![](../media/generate_new.jpg)

      >**Note:** The summarize text sample consists of a *prompt* that provides some text to tell the model what kind of response is required and include some contextual information.

1. At the bottom of the page, note the number of *tokens* detected in the text. Tokens are the basic units of a prompt - essentially words or word-parts in the text.

1. Use the **Generate** button to submit the prompt to the model and retrieve a response (you may need to scroll down). The response consists of a quiz based on the example in the prompt.

      ![](../media/generated.jpg)

      >**Note**: You can use the **Regenerate** button to resubmit the prompt(new changes have been made), and note that the response may vary from the original one. A generative AI model can produce new language each time it's called.

1. Use the **View Code** button to view the code that a client application would use to submit the prompt. 

      ![](../media/view_code.jpg)

1. You can select your preferred programming language **(1)** then naviage to the **Key authentication (2)**.The prompt contains the text you submitted to the model. The request is submitted to the *Completions* API for your Azure OpenAI service.      

      ![](../media/open-ai1.png)
    
7. Close the **Sample Code**.

### Task 4: Use the Chat playground

In this task, you'll use the Chat playground to interact with and test the AI model's conversational abilities through a simulated chat interface.

1. In the **Playground** section, select the **Chat (1)** page, and ensure that the **my-gpt-model (2)** model is selected in the configuration pane.

      ![](../media/open-ai2.png)

1. In the **Setup** section, in the **System message** box, replace the current text with the following statement: `The system is an AI teacher that helps people learn about AI`.

1. Below the **+ Add section** box, click on **Examples**. enter the following message and response in the designated boxes:

      ![](../media/last-2.jpg)

1.  Enter the following message and response in the designated boxes:

       - **User**: `What are different types of artificial intelligence?`
    
       - **Assistant**: `There are three main types of artificial intelligence: Narrow or Weak AI (such as virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, image recognition software, and spam filters), General or Strong AI (AI designed to be as intelligent as a human being. This type of AI does not currently exist and is purely theoretical), and Artificial Superintelligence (AI that is more intelligent than any human being and can 
perform tasks that are beyond human comprehension. This type of AI is also purely theoretical and has not yet been developed).`

            ![](../media/exples-ai.jpg)
   
            > **Note**: Few-shot examples are used to provide the model with examples of the types of responses that are expected. The model will attempt to reflect the tone and style of the examples in its own responses.

1. Save the changes by clicking on **Save (1)** and subsequently click on **Continue (2)** to start a new session and set the behavioral context of the chat system.

      ![](../media/open-ai3.png)   

1. In the query box at the bottom of the page, enter the text `What is artificial intelligence?`.  **(1)** Use the **Send (2)** button to submit the message and view the response.

      ![](../media/openai-12.png)
   
      > **Note**: You may receive a response that the API deployment is not yet ready. If so, wait for a few minutes and try again.

1. Review the response and then submit the following message to continue the conversation: `How is it related to machine learning?`

1. Review the response, noting that context from the previous interaction is retained (so the model understands that "it" refers to artificial intelligence).

1. Use the **View Code** button to view the code for the interaction. The prompt consists of the *system* message, the few-shot examples of *user* and *assistant* messages, and the sequence of *user* and *assistant* messages in the chat session so far.

      ![](../media/view_code.jpg)

      ![](../media/open-ai4.png)       

### Task 5: Explore prompts and parameters

In this task, you'll explore prompts and parameters by experimenting with different inputs and settings to fine-tune the AI model's responses and behavior.

1. On the **Setup** page select **Parameter (1)** , set the following parameter values:
    
    - **Temperature**: 0 **(2)**
    
    - **Max response**: 500 **(3)**

   ![](../media/open-ai5.png)
      
1. Submit the following message in chat session

      ```
     Write three multiple choice questions based on the following text.

      Most computer vision solutions are based on machine learning models that can be applied to visual input from cameras, videos, or images.*

      - Image classification involves training a machine learning model to classify images based on their contents. For example, in a traffic monitoring solution you might use an image classification model to    
        classify images based on the type of vehicle they contain, such as taxis, buses, cyclists, and so on.*

      - Object detection machine learning models are trained to classify individual objects within an image, and identify their location with a bounding box. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might use 
        object detection to identify the location of different classes of vehicle.*

      - Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong. For example, a traffic monitoring solution 
        might overlay traffic images with "mask" layers to highlight different vehicles using specific colors.
      ```

1. Review the results, which should consist of multiple-choice questions that a teacher could use to test students on the computer vision topics in the prompt. The total response should be smaller than the maximum length you specified as a parameter.

      ![](../media/last-3.jpg)
   
1. Observe the following about the prompt and parameters you used:
       - The prompt specifically states that the desired output should be three multiple choice questions.
       - The parameters include *Temperature*, which controls the degree to which response generation includes an element of randomness. The value of **0** used in your submission minimizes randomness, resulting in stable, predictable responses.

### Task 6: Explore code-generation

In this task, you'll explore code-generation by testing the AI model’s ability to generate and suggest code snippets based on various programming prompts and requirements.

1. In the **Setup** pane, under the **System message**, enter the system message: `You are a Python developer.` **(1)** then save the changes by clicking on **Save (2)** when prompted click on **Continue (3)**.

      ![](../media/open-ai7.png)

1. In the **Chat session** pane, select **Clear chat** to clear the chat history and start a new session.

1. Submit the following user message:

      ```
     Write a Python function named Multiply that multiplies two numeric parameters.
      ```

1. Review the response, which should include sample Python code that meets the requirement in the prompt.
