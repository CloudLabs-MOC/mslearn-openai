# Lab 02: Generate images with a DALL-E model

### Estimated Duration: 90 minutes

## Lab scenario
The Azure OpenAI Service includes an image-generation model named DALL-E. You can use this model to submit natural language prompts that describe a desired image, and the model will generate an original image based on the description you provide.

In this exercise, you'll use a DALL-E version 3 model to generate images based on natural language prompts.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Explore image-generation in the DALL-E playground
- Task 2: Use the REST API to generate images
- Task 3.1: Prepare the app environment
- Task 3.2: Configure your application
- Task 3.3: View application code
- Task 4: Run the app

### Task 1: Explore image generation in the DALL-E playground

### Task 2: Use the REST API to generate images

The Azure OpenAI service provides a REST API that you can use to submit prompts for content generation - including images generated by a DALL-E model.

#### Task 2.1: Prepare the app environment

In this exercise, you'll use a simple Python or Microsoft C# app to generate images by calling the REST API. You'll run the code in the cloud shell console interface in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), select the **[>_]** (*Cloud Shell*) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. A Cloud Shell pane will open at the bottom of 
   the portal.

    ![Screenshot of starting Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon to the right of the top search box.](../media/cloudshell-launch-portal.png#lightbox)

1. Make sure the type of shell indicated on the top left of the Cloud Shell pane is switched to *Bash*. If it's *PowerShell*, switch to *Bash* by using the drop-down menu.

1. Once the terminal starts, enter the following command to download the application code you are going to work with.

    ```bash
    rm -r azure-openai -f
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-openai azure-openai
    ```

    The files are downloaded to a folder named **azure-openai**. Applications for both C# and Python have been provided. Both apps feature the same functionality.

    > **NOTE:** if you get Message saying already cloned , please move the next step.

1. Navigate to the folder for the language of your preference  by running the appropriate command.

    **Python**

    ```bash
    cd azure-openai/Labfiles/05-image-generation/Python
    ```

    **C#**

    ```bash
    cd azure-openai/Labfiles/05-image-generation/CSharp
    ```

1. Use the following command to open the built-in code editor and see the code files you will be working with.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

1. When prompted to **Switch to Classic Cloud Shell** after running the **code .** command, click on **Confirm** and make sure you are in the correct project path.

   ![](../media/classic-cloudshell-prompt.png)

1. Repeat the commands you executed in steps 4 and 5 for the language of your preference.
 
#### Task 2.2: Configure your application

The application uses a configuration file to store the details needed to connect to your Azure OpenAI service account.

1. In the code editor, select the configuration file for your app - depending on your language preference.

    - C#: `appsettings.json`
    - Python: `.env`
    
2. Update the configuration values to include the **Endpoint** and **Key1** for your Azure OpenAI service. Then save the file by right-clicking the file from the left pane.

    > **Tip**: You can adjust the split at the top of the cloud shell pane to see the Azure portal, and get the endpoint and key values from the **Keys and Endpoint** page for your Azure OpenAI service.

3. If you are using **Python**, you'll also need to install the **python-dotenv** package used to read the configuration file. In the console prompt pane, ensure the current folder is **~/azure-openai/Labfiles/05- 
   image-generation/Python**. Then enter this command:

    ```bash
    pip install --user python-dotenv
    ```
4. In the code editor, select the configuration file for your app - depending on your language preference and **replace** the existing model name `dalle3` to `dall-e-3`.

    - C#: `Program.cs`

      - image
     
      - image

    - Python: `generate-image.py`
  
      - image
     
      - image
      
#### Task 2.3: View application code

Now you're ready to explore the code used to call the REST API and generate an image.

1. In the code editor pane, select the main code file for your application:

    - C#: `Program.cs`
    - Python: `generate-image.py`

2. Review the code that the file contains, noting the following key features:

   >**Note** : right-click on the file from the left pane, and hit **Save**
   
    - The code makes https requests to the endpoint for your service, including the key for your service in the header. Both of these values are obtained from the configuration file.
    - The process consists of <u>two</u> REST requests: One to initiate the image-generation request, and another to retrieve the results.
    The initial request includes the following data:
        - The user-provided prompt that describes the image to be generated
        - The number of images to be generated (in this case, 1)
        - The resolution (size) of the image to be generated.
    - The response header from the initial request includes an **operation-location** value that is used for the subsequent callback to get the results.
    - The code polls the callback URL until the status of the image-generation task is *succeeded*, and then extracts and displays a URL for the generated image.

### Task 3: Run the app

Now that you've reviewed the code, it's time to run it and generate some images.

1. If you're following **C#** Lanaguage kindly open **generate_image.csproj** file replace with following code and save the file before moving to next step.

    ```
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
   
     <PropertyGroup>
       <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
       <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
       <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
       <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
     </PropertyGroup>
     <PropertyGroup>
       <MSBuildWarningsAsMessages>$(MSBuildWarningsAsMessages);CS8600;CS8602</MSBuildWarningsAsMessages>
     </PropertyGroup>
   
     <ItemGroup>
       <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration" Version="8.0.*" />
       <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json" Version="8.0.*" />
     </ItemGroup>
   
     <ItemGroup>
       <None Update="appsettings.json">
         <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
       </None>
     </ItemGroup>
   
   </Project>
   
   ```

1. In the console prompt pane, enter the appropriate command to run your application:

    **Python**

    ```bash
   pip install --user requests
   python generate-image.py
    ```

    **C#**

    ```bash
   dotnet run
    ```

2. When prompted, enter a description for an image. For example, *A giraffe flying a kite*.

   >**Note**: If you encounter an issue after entering prompts kindly follow the below steps:
   
      - Enter a description of an image you'd like to generate in the **Prompt** box (for example, *An elephant on a skateboard*), and then select **Generate** to view the resulting image.
   
         >**Note**: if you encounter error **The API deployment for this resource does not exist**, kindly wait 2 mins and try again to generate. 
   
      - Navigate back to CloudShell and reperform step no 2. 

3. Wait for the image to be generated - a hyperlink will be displayed in the console pane. Then select the hyperlink to open a new browser tab and review the image that was generated.

4. Close the tab containing the generated image and re-run the app to generate a new image with a different prompt.
