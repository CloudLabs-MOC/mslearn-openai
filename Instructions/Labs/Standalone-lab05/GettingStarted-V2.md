### Overall Estimated Duration: 1 Hour

## Overview

In this hands-on-lab, you will explore the capabilities of Azure OpenAI Service models  you will gain an understanding of how these models can explain and simplify complex code, making it easier to comprehend and improve. The lab will also introduce you to the DALL-E model, where you will practice generating original images by submitting natural language prompts, focusing on the creative potential of AI in visual content creation.

## Objective 

- **Generate images with a DALL-E model**: The goal of this hands-on activity is to produce and alter images using the DALL-E model. To attain the intended visual results, you will develop and alter images using the DALL-E model.

## Prerequisites

1. **Development Skills**: Basic programming knowledge and experience with APIs and SDKs.
2. **AI Concepts**: Understanding prompt engineering, code development, and image generation using models such as DALL-E.
3. **Content Management**: Understanding data integration for RAG and content filtering techniques.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, you will follow an architecture flow that begins with exploring Azure OpenAI Service models, where you'll use natural language prompts to generate and enhance code. The flow progresses through stages of code generation, bug fixing, and detailed commenting, leveraging AI to simplify and explain complex code. The final stage introduces the DALL-E model, where you'll practice generating original images from natural language prompts, highlighting the creative potential of AI in visual content creation. This flow seamlessly integrates AI-driven coding and creative image generation, providing a comprehensive understanding of Azure OpenAI's capabilities.
