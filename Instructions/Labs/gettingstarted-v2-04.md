# Generate and improve code with Azure OpenAI Service

### Overall Estimated Duration: 1 hour
## Overview

This lab explores the Azure OpenAI Service, where you'll provision the service, deploy a model, generate code using the Chat playground, configure and run an application in Cloud Shell, and enhance user interactions.

## Objective

This lab provides hands-on experience with Azure OpenAI resources, covering tasks such as provisioning a resource, deploying a model, generating code in the Chat playground, setting up and configuring an application in Cloud Shell, and running the application. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Generate and improve code with Azure OpenAI Service:** The goal of this hands-on exercise is to demonstrate how to effectively generate and refine code using Azure OpenAI. Participants will improve their abilities to create and refine code with Azure OpenAI Service tools and approaches.

## Pre-requisites

- **Development Skills:** Basic programming knowledge and experience with APIs and SDKs.

- **AI Concepts:** Understanding prompt engineering, code development, and image generation using models such as DALL-E.

- **Content Management:** Understanding data integration for RAG and content filtering techniques.

## Architecture

The architecture leverages Azure OpenAI Service to provision resources, deploy models, and set up an application in Cloud Shell. It includes configuring, testing, and running the application, enabling AI-driven solutions with Azure's scalability and security.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Azure OpenAI Resource:** Provision an Azure OpenAI resource to access OpenAI’s advanced AI models and integrate them into custom applications.

- **Model Deployment:** Deploy an OpenAI model to enable functionality for testing and application use cases.

- **Code Generation:** Generate code in the Chat playground to enhance the model’s capabilities and assist with development tasks.

- **Application Setup:** Set up an application in Cloud Shell to interact with the deployed model and test its capabilities.

- **Application Configuration:** Configure the application to meet specific requirements, ensuring seamless integration with Azure OpenAI services.

- **Run the Application:** Run the application to validate its functionality and ensure effective interaction with the deployed model.

## Getting Started with Lab

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) and lab guide will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab. You can see the number on the lab guide bottom area to switch to different exercises of the lab guide.
