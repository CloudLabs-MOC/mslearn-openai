# Generate images with a DALL-E model

### Overall Estimated Duration: 1 hour

## Overview

This lab explores the Azure OpenAI Service, where you'll provision the service, explore image-generation in the DALL-E playground, use the REST API to generate images, configure and run an application, and enhance your ability to create AI-driven applications.

## Objective

This lab provides hands-on experience with Azure OpenAI resources, covering tasks such as provisioning a resource, deploying a model, exploring image generation in the DALL-E playground, using the REST API to generate images, setting up and configuring an application in Cloud Shell, and running the application. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Generate images with a DALL-E model:** The goal of this hands-on activity is to produce and alter images using the DALL-E model. To attain the intended visual results, participants will develop and alter images using the DALL-E model.

## Pre-requisites

- **Development Skills:** Basic programming knowledge and experience with APIs and SDKs.

- **AI Concepts:** Understanding prompt engineering, code development, and image generation using models such as DALL-E.

- **Content Management:** Understanding data integration for RAG and content filtering techniques.

## Architecture

The architecture utilizes Azure OpenAI Service to provision resources, deploy models, and configure an application in Cloud Shell. It involves setting up, testing, and running the application, enabling AI-driven solutions powered by Azure's scalability and security.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Azure OpenAI Resource:** Provision an Azure OpenAI resource to access OpenAIâ€™s advanced AI models, enabling integration with custom applications.

- **DALL-E Playground:** Explore image generation capabilities using the DALL-E playground to create custom images based on text prompts.

- **REST API for Image Generation:** Use the REST API to generate images programmatically, integrating image generation into your application.

- **Run the Application:** Execute the application to validate the image generation functionality and confirm proper interaction with the deployed model.

## Getting Started with Lab

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) and lab guide will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab. You can see the number on the lab guide bottom area to switch to different exercises of the lab guide.

    > If you are getting popup **save password**, then select **Save & Turn on** option.
       
1. If you see the pop-up **Stay Signed in?**, click **No**.

1. If you see the pop-up **You have free Azure Advisor recommendations!**, close the window to continue the lab.

1. If a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** popup window appears, click **Maybe Later** to skip the tour.

1. Now you will see Azure Portal Dashboard, click on **Resource groups** from the Navigate panel to see the resource groups.

     ![](../media/select-rg.png "Resource groups")

1. Confirm you have a resource group **openai-<inject key="Deployment-id" enableCopy="false"/>** present as shown in the below screenshot. You need to use the **openai-<inject key="Deployment-id" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group throughout the entire process of lab execution.
