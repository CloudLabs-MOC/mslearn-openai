# Add your data for RAG with Azure OpenAI Service

### Overall Estimated Duration: 2 hour

## Overview

This lab explores the Azure OpenAI Service, where you'll provision the service, deploy a model, connect your own data in the chat playground, interact with a model grounded in your data, and set up, configure, and run an application. By the end of this lab, you'll enhance your ability to create AI-driven applications with Azure.

## Objective

This lab provides hands-on experience with Azure OpenAI resources, including provisioning a resource, deploying a model, connecting your data in the chat playground, setting up and configuring an application in Cloud Shell, and running the application. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Add your data for RAG using Azure OpenAI Service:** This hands-on exercise will help you integrate your data with the Azure OpenAI Service for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve AI responses. Participants will integrate data into the Azure OpenAI Service to boost AI-powered retrieval and generation.

## Pre-requisites

- **Development Skills:** Basic programming knowledge and experience with APIs and SDKs.

- **AI Concepts:** Understanding prompt engineering, code development, and image generation using models such as DALL-E.

- **Content Management:** Understanding data integration for RAG and content filtering techniques.

## Architecture

The architecture leverages Azure OpenAI Service to provision resources, deploy models, and configure an application in Cloud Shell. It includes connecting data, setting up, testing, and running the application, enabling AI-driven solutions with Azure’s scalability and security.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Azure OpenAI Resource:** Provision an Azure OpenAI resource to access OpenAI’s advanced AI models, enabling integration with custom applications.

- **Model Deployment:** Deploy an OpenAI model to access and utilize its functionality for testing and application use cases.

- **Chat Behavior Exploration:** Observe the normal chat behavior without adding custom data, interacting with the model's default capabilities.

- **Data Integration:** Connect your own data to the chat playground to ground the model’s responses in your custom content.

- **Chat with Data-Driven Model:** Interact with a model grounded in your own data, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of the responses.

- **Application Configuration:** Configure the application to ensure smooth integration with Azure OpenAI services and meet specific requirements.

- **Run the Application:** Execute the application to validate the image generation functionality and confirm proper interaction with the deployed model.

## Getting Started with Lab

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) and lab guide will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab. You can see the number on the lab guide bottom area to switch to different exercises of the lab guide.
