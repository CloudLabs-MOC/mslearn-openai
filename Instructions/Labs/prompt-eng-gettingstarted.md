# Build Prompt Engineering with Azure OpenAI Service

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will explore the concept of prompt engineering, learning how to craft effective prompts for AI models. You'll get hands-on experience with Azure OpenAI Playground, experimenting with different types of prompts and understanding their elements and design tips. The way developers shape their prompts significantly impacts the generative AI model's responses, allowing for tailored and formatted content when requested clearly and concisely. You'll learn how different prompts for similar content can shape the AI model's response to better satisfy your requirements.

You will explore how to use generative AI to improve advertising emails and categorize articles for your team. The prompt engineering techniques used in the exercise apply to various use cases. Tuning prompts to achieve the desired results is the core idea behind prompt engineering.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Introduction to Prompt Engineering & Azure OpenAI Foundry (Read-Only):** Learn to craft effective prompts for AI models using Azure OpenAI Playground, experimenting with different types and design tips. This hands-on experience will help you understand how different prompt styles influence AI responses and improve your results.
- **Utilize prompt engineering in your app:** Provision an Azure OpenAI resource, deploy a model, apply prompt engineering in the chat playground, set up and configure an application in Cloud Shell, and run your application to see the results.
- **Advanced Concepts (Read-Only):** Master the art of tuning prompts to achieve specific outcomes and explore advanced methods for refining AI outputs, all without the need for fine-tuning GPT models. Learn how to leverage prompt adjustments and design techniques to enhance model responses effectively.
- **Fine Tuning (Read-Only):** Master prompt engineering using Azure OpenAI Playground to refine AI responses, tailoring outputs for specific tasks such as enhancing advertising emails and categorizing articles.
